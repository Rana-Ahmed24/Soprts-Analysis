# Padel Tennis Tracker ðŸŽ¾  
A video analysis tool for tracking players, the ball, and scoring in Padel Tennis matches. This project leverages **YOLO (You Only Look Once)** models to detect and track objects in real-time.

## Features
- **Player Tracking**: Identifies players on the court and tracks their movements.
- **Ball Tracking**: Detects the ball, interpolates missing positions, and identifies hits.
- **Scoring System**: Automatically updates the scoreboard based on ball movements across the court.
- **Visualization**: Overlays bounding boxes, player IDs, and a live scoreboard on the video.
- **Mini Court**: Displays a scaled-down version of the court for better visualization.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/padel-tennis-tracker.git
   cd padel-tennis-tracker
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Download pre-trained YOLO models and place them in the `models/` directory.

---

## Usage
1. Place your input videos in the `input_videos/` folder.
2. Run the main script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Use the Gradio interface to upload a video or select from the `input_videos/` folder.
4. The output video with tracking and scoring will be saved in the `output_videos/` folder.

## Visual Workflow

### 1. Input Video
A raw video of a Padel Tennis match is loaded.

![Input Video Example](https://via.placeholder.com/600x300?text=Input+Video)  

---

### 2. Detection and Tracking
- Players are identified and assigned unique IDs.
- The ball's trajectory is tracked and interpolated for missing frames.

---

### 3. Scoreboard Overlay
The live scoreboard is updated based on ball movements and displayed on the video.

---

### 4. Mini Court Visualization
A scaled-down version of the court visualizes player and ball positions.

---

### 5. Output Video
The final video contains:
- Bounding boxes for players and the ball.
- Updated scoreboard.
- Mini court overlay.

## Customization
- Update `constants.py` to adjust scoring rules or court dimensions.
- Replace YOLO models in the `models/` folder for improved detection accuracy.
